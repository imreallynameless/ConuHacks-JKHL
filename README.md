This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

National Bank Sponsor Challenge: Seeing the Forest for the Trees
Today anyone can go on their phone and search up the price of a stock and
immediately get an answer. What is that price and where does it come from? At
its simplest, that price is the execution price of the most recent
transaction. Better than nothing but not it is not particularly useful if you
want to trade; that price doesnâ€™t tell you what price you would get.
In this challenge, we want to take you behind the scenes and show you the
inner workings of equity markets. Exchanges have an order book where all the
buy and sell orders are recorded. Market participants, like National Bank,
are in constant communication with those exchanges, continuously creating,
modifying, and deleting orders on most securities to reflect the latest
information.
We are going to be providing teams with a sample of the conversation National
Bank has with three different exchanges from 9:28AM and 9:32AM, totaling more
than 200k messages. While this sample is but a small fraction of what we do,
it should give a sense of scale. We want students to render and visualize
this data in real time; your work should result in a ~4minute animated
visualization. The goal is to expose patterns in the data that would not be
obvious if looking on a message per message basis.
There are multiple ways to render this data, the goal is to expose the most
dimensions possible through shapes, colors, movement, or anything else. The
more creative a group is the better they will be judged. There are no
specified languages or APIs that you must use but a web-based application is
preferable. Bonus marks will be given to projects that have integrated
anomaly detection!
Projects will be judged on its creativity, complexity, its completeness, and
the bonus. The project that impresses our team the most will receive: $500
dollars to each member of the team, an office visit for the team, a
guaranteed interview, and finally a day with our teams.
Prize: 4 x 500$ cheque, with an office visit & interview

We use 'stars' of varying sizes to indicate how big (volume) each message is.
Stars that are larger will last longer and be bigger.
We will have an axis where it increases as the stock price increases and what not
